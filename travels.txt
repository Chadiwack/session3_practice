My favorite places I've traveled too and why:
Cancun, Mexico: I traveled here for my older brother's wedding, we stayed at an all inclusive and i ate more food than I've ever eaten.
Las Vegas, Nevada: My friends and I came here to watch our buddy Bo perform in a national bowling championship, I did almost no gambling but a lot of people watching.
Orlando, Florida: Though I went here as a child I still remember how excited I was to finally get to go to orlando studios, and how utterly terrified I ended up being of almost every ride.
